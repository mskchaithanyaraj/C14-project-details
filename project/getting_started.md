# 🚀 Getting Started with Your Flood Detection Base Paper

This guide will help you understand your base paper's implementation and provide a clear, step-by-step process for setting up and rerunning the original model, from dataset preparation through executing the code—whether in Jupyter Notebook, PyCharm, or VSCode.

## 1. 📊 Understanding the Base Paper Implementation

### 🎯 Objective

Segment flooded areas from satellite images using a modified U-Net architecture.

- **Input**: Satellite images (RGB+NIR), with annotated masks for flooded/non-flooded regions.
- **Output**: Pixel-wise classification mask (flood/no flood).

## 2. 🛠️ What You Need to Reproduce the Results

### A. 📋 Prerequisites

- **Python** (version 3.7+ recommended)
- **Basic familiarity** with Jupyter Notebook, PyCharm, or VSCode (choose one IDE to start; Jupyter Notebook is beginner-friendly)
- **GPU recommended** (for reasonable training time)
- **Pip or Conda** (for installing libraries)

#### 📦 Essential Libraries

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`
- `opencv-python`
- `tensorflow` and `keras` (or `pytorch`, if code uses it)
- `albumentations` (for data augmentation)
- `tifffile` (for GeoTIFF)
- `tqdm`

### B. 📁 Dataset Preparation

#### Download MediaEval 2017 Flood Dataset

- You need images and their masks; these are in GeoTIFF format.
- **Dataset link**: Search for "MediaEval 2017 flood satellite data" (request access if needed).

#### Organize Folders

- `data/images/` : input satellite images
- `data/masks/` : corresponding segmentation masks

### C. 📂 Project Structure (Typical Layout)

```

```

### D. ⚙️ How to Set Up Your Environment

Depending on your comfort, choose one:

#### 🔵 Option 1: Jupyter Notebook (Recommended for Beginners)

- Install via Anaconda or pip (`pip install notebook`)
- Run `jupyter notebook` and open the `notebooks/flood_detection_unet.ipynb` file
- Each step—data loading, preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation—will be in its own code cell

#### 🔶 Option 2: PyCharm or VSCode

- Standard Python IDEs for larger projects or script-based workflows
- Open project folder
- Ensure Python interpreter is set (point to your environment)
- Run scripts (`preprocess.py`, `model.py`, `train.py`, `evaluate.py`) from the terminal or directly in the IDE

### E. 🏃‍♂️ Run the Model: Step-by-Step

1. **Clone/download** the project repo/code (or structure your folders/scripts as above).

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download/organize dataset** as described above.

4. **Run data preprocessing**:

   - Generates processed images/masks for training

5. **Run model training**:

   - Trains the U-Net model using the `train.py` script or training cells in notebook

6. **Evaluate and visualize**:
   - Use the evaluation script or notebook cells to generate segmentation metrics and overlay masks on test images

### F. 🧠 Algorithms and Methods Already in the Code

#### **Modified U-Net**:

- MobileNetV2 encoder
- Transposed convolution upsampling decoder
- Skip connections

#### **Augmentation**:

Flips, rotations, brightness

#### **Loss**:

Binary cross-entropy with Dice loss

#### **Optimization**:

Adam optimizer with learning rate scheduling

#### **Validation**:

Split into train, validation, test (70-20-10)

#### **Metrics**:

IoU, Dice, Precision, Recall, F1

#### **Explainability (optional)**:

Producing output heatmaps for model confidence

## 3. 💡 Tips for Beginners

- **Start with Jupyter Notebook**: The visual feedback and cell-based workflow make it easy to experiment and understand.

- **Check your GPU**: Significantly faster training if available (use Google Colab as an alternative).

- **Read the code line by line**: Use comments and documentation to understand each step—especially data preprocessing, model architecture, and training loops.

- **Experiment with sample data first**: Try running everything on a few images before scaling up.

## 4. 🎯 What's Next?

Once you've successfully reproduced the base model's results and understand the workflow, you'll be ready to implement your improvement ideas (e.g., adding SAR data, diverse datasets, temporal analysis).
